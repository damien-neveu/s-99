# S-99: Solutions to Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

This is my take on the [99 Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) an adaptation of the [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://prof.ti.bfh.ch/hew1/informatik3/prolog/p-99/)

I'm planning on working on the _intermediate_ and _difficult_ problems only, but that'll depend how lazy I am. 

## Run tests

```bash
sbt clean compile
sbt test
```
